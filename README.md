**Just 50 words is a simple text editor designed to help lazy writers, like me, build a habit of writing.**  
   
It features:  

- A smart editor that automatically saves as you write and has other nifty features that saves you time as you write.
- Word counter with the ability to set word targets and then get positive feedback on achieving those targets.
- A complete Pomodoro system to set writing session intervals so that you can use short focussed intervals to write.
- A Write or Nuke feature where if you stop writing before completing the target words, everything that you wrote is cleared. This forces you to achieve your target words more often.
- Almost everything can be configured
- and a UI designed for the rest of us.

# Why should I use this editor
I have been using this app for the past month or so to write something everyday. And it works.
I have never created so much content in such a short time, in my life and I believe that this editor played a very important role in it. Since I know how lazy I am, I tried to implement features that takes that into account.
