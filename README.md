# What is "Just 50 words"
Just 50 words is a text editor, similar to other plain text editors like NotePad++, etc with built in utilities to help the lazy writers, like me, build a habit of writing. 

It features: 
- A smart editor that automatically saves as you write and has other nifty features that saves you time as you write.
- Word counter with the ability to set word targets and then get positive feedback on achieving those targets.
- A complete Pomodoro system to set writing session intervals so that you can use short focussed intervals to write.
- A Write or Nuke feature where if you stop writing before completing the target words, everything that you wrote is cleared. This forces you to achieve your target words more often.
- Almost everything can be configured
- and a UI designed for the rest of us.
