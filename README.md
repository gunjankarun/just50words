# Just50words

A simple to use editor that I am building to help me write at least 50 words daily.

This is a desktop app that  

- enables you to write articles in a distraction free environment, 
- motivates you to write more by showing the count of words
- has interval writing features to help you write in short spurts

This is a free app. Free to download and use. I do not show any ads or in app purchases. This is my gift to you all awesome people who love to write. 

If you are a coder and know JavaScript, you are welcome to download it's code and add more features and functionality to it. 

If you are not a coder/programmer but want some features that is not here, feel free to tell me at my email address. 

Also, if you find this useful, a small donation to support me would be great help.
