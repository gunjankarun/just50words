Features
--------

### A smart yet simple to use editor
#### ...because you should focus on writing only.

Just 50 Word features a clean editor that prioritizes making your writing more efficient, as compared to fancy features like formatting etc. There are a lot of available software (MS Word, Open Office, Google Docs, Medium editor etc) that will do all the formatting for you. This editor focuses on a minimalistic and zen writing experience. We built features like automatic identification of complicated bullets, automatic sequencing of numbers, auto-completion of brackets, quotes, automatic saves, easy management of articles etc... all aimed to make your writing process a bit less stressful.

### Writing prompt generator
#### ...because sometimes we need a little help to get started

Specially designed for people who write non-fiction articles, this tool suggests headlines or writing prompts for your selected keyword or phrase. Use these headlines/prompts as a starting point for your research and writing.

### Inbuilt Pomodoro timer
#### ...because short bursts of focussed writing is a proven technique

If you use timers or follow Pomodoro technique to write in short focussed sessions with regular breaks, we have you covered. We have a full featured timer with timed breaks to help you focus on your writing.

### Write or get Nuked
#### ...because sometimes a negative reinforcement makes us more productive

Sometimes, you need a negative reinforcement (aka punishment) for procrastinating (aka being lazy). If you switch on the "Write or Nuke" option, then you are not allowed to stop typing until you reach the target number of words. If you stop for more than 30 seconds before completing the target number of words, that article will get deleted.

### ability to configure everything
#### ...because each one of us have a unique style of writing

You can customize Just 50 Words to make it work for you. You can change writing targets, change the writing interface, audio cues, timer durations, write or nuke properties etc.

### Free and Open Source
#### ...because some of the best things in life are free... and open source :)

Just 50 Words is a free software. The source code is also available for download. So if you have an idea for a new feature, you can simply make the changes in the source code and build your own version of Just 50 Words.

### Easy learning curve
#### ...because our time is more useful writing, not learning about a new writing tool

Just 50 Words has been designed to be easy to use. You do not need to study long user manuals, complicated workflows etc. Just have a look at the short walkthrough video and you are ready to go.
